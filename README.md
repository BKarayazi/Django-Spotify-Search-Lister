# Task
This project was developed using django  to fulfill requirements of a assignment i was given. Aim of the assignment was to create a web application which picks a random artist from genres.json file depending the genre requested and list them at a results page.

# Requirements
Django 3.2.7
requests 2.26.0
```
 python -m pip install Django 
 python -m pip install requests
```

# Usage
On windows open project folder using command prompt and type:

```
 python manage.py runserver
```

or I also included launch.json inside files, so if you open project folder with Visual Studio Code and start the project it should also start the server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
